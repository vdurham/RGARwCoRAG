Patient continued to\\nbecome more bradycardic, transcutaneous pacing was started.\\nHemodynamics and respiratory status worsened. Code blue was\\ncalled. On holding transcutaneous pacing, patient was shown to\\nbe in PEA arrest. Patient was coded with CPR, a total of 5\\nrounds of epinephrine, 3 rounds of atropine, 2 rounds of bicarb,\\n1 round of vasopressin.
